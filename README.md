# Gif expert App

This is a small and simple application in which gifs are searched based on the category sent by the user. It is an application developed with React.

## Execution

The application is currently deployed on Netlify at the following URL: `https://649da0a5f3e5531f9a34d031--courageous-creponne-9d91f2.netlify.app`

##### Here are the steps to clone the repository and run the application:
1. git clone repostiroy
    `https://github.com/johann2912/React-gifApp.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    `cd <project_directory>`

3. Install the dependencies using Yarn:
    `yarn install`

4. Run the application in development mode:
    `yarn dev`

These steps assume that you have Yarn installed on your system. Make sure to replace <repository_url> with the actual URL of the repository you want to clone, and <project_directory> with the desired directory name where you want to store the project files.

By following these steps, you should be able to clone the repository, install the dependencies, and run the application locally using the yarn dev command.
